Applicant tracking system
Applicant can sign up (jwts)
Store the password as a hash (use built-in library), not as plain text in your database
They can fill out a form mentioning their preferred position, their tech stack, etc
On the backend, we write an api endpoint for signup
We persist all the data to a database
List of open jobs (put some dummy job details in the details). We don’t need functionality to apply for jobs.

Recruiter can also signup/login
Recruiter sees a list of job seekers
Recruiter can filter based in different fields

		Schema of ATS System

Users (name, email, userRole (enum: Applicant or a Recruiter))
Jobs (job title, location, pay, description)

Example query for listing job seekers:

Select * from Users where role = ‘Applicant’


1.) Main languages usesd will be python and flask
2.) Project should be pretty evenly balanced between frontend and backend. Pulling info from api and storing sensitive passwords as well.
3.) This will just be a website
4.) The goal is to create an Applicant tracking system
5.) This website site would be used by Recruiters posting jobs for their company and Candidates looking for a job
6.) I will create my own API, storing user info, job info, etc.
7.) 
  c. Passwords would be the only sensitive info to store
  d. Creating profile, posting job, apply to job
